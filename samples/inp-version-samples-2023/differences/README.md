The transcript in "differences.txt" shows the differences between the .OUT
files written by macOS and Windows and between macOS and linux for the
files 'inferno.inp' and 'normal.inp'.  The differences consist of the
runtime timestamps and differences in calculated values like volume flow
and heat gains, due to slightly different treatment of floating point
calculations in the different OSes.
