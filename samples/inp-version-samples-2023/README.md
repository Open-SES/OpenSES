Two input files in this folder (inferno.inp and normal.inp) have been
modified to run with a version number in form 1B.

Each of the files has been run on macOS, linux and Windows.  The relevant
.OUT files are stored in the subfolder 'differences', along with a transcript
comparing their contents (in the subfolder's README.md file).  There are
slight differences in the volume flows and heat gains, due to how the
different operating systems handle floating-point calculations.
