OpenSES file for triggering error messages.                                     
This file has an OpenSES version number in form 1B between the 31st and         
40th characters but the version number is too high.

*ERROR* TYPE 1004                    ******************************
Found an input file version number that was higher than this
version of OpenSES can handle (this is OpenSES v4.3ALPHA, the file
can only be run in v99.9 or higher).  Please either use a newer
version of OpenSES or edit the file to reduce the input file
version to between 4.2 and 4.3.
Faulty line of input is:
> 17.       7         2022      99.9
Faulty file is "fault-1004-GetVersion.INP".
