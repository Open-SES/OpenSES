OpenSES file for testing code to handle input file versions.                    
This file has an OpenSES version number in form 1B that is 4.25, which is       
accepted as an interim, development version of the program.

This OpenSES input file is a version 4.25 input file.
This version number has not been assigned a description
in GetVersion, so it must be a development run.
